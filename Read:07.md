# Javascript

* A  script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in  order to achieve a goal. 

* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 

* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 

* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
