# Function:

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

# loobs:

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==,  ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 

* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
