* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps Xconvey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: XRGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast Xbetween any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to Xindicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, Xwith an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
